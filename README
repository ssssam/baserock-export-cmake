Baserock definitions -> CMake build instructions
================================================

What?
-----

This is a proof of concept 'Baserock exporter'. Given some build/integration
instructions represented as [Baserock
definitions](https://wiki.baserock.org/definitions), such as the [Baserock
reference system
definitions](https://git.baserock.org/cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/baserock/baserock/definitions.git/tree),
it will generate [CMake](https://www.cmake.org) build instructions, from which
you can then generate a Makefile or [Ninja build rule file](http://www.ninja-build.org)
that will do the actual compilation and build you a Baserock system.

It's just a proof of concept at this point and it may not have any use.
It would be interesting to compare this with Buildroot, another Make-based
build/integration tool.

Does it work?
-------------

Not really.

The generated build system creates a couple of syntax warnings when run through
CMake.

Then, the build of fhs-dirs fails because none of the necessary environment
variables are set.

Next steps would be:

	- set PREFIX and DESTDIR correctly during build and install
	- add an `artifact creation` step after installation
